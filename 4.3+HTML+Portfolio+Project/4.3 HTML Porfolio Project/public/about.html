<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Coming from an intellectual family who believes in exploring their education in as many ways as they can, I have been born and brought up with the same purpose of scrutinizing every field of education and acquiring knowledge as much as I can. My parents have always provided me with a supportive environment which has always helped to deal with my problems and ups and downs in my life. During my summer vacations, I used to sit in front of my computer for hours and try to learn more and more about its different and unique features. I always wanted to pursue my career in the computer field. I had a computer subject in my 10th standard, and in that class, our computer subject teachers used to teach the real-world applications of computer technology. They taught us why it is important to learn this subject and it was the experience that sparked a deep interest in me to learn more about the working of the computer system. Later on, after completing my 12th grade I took advice from one of my uncles who is a computer engineer by profession. He showed me various options in the field of computer in which I can pursue my career, for example as a Data Analyst, Web Developer, Software Developer, etc. which amazed me a lot. “Necessity is the mother of invention” and it has made our life much easier. I started to research to explore my options more and concluded that Computer Engineering is the best way to comprehend it. That was the reason I chose Computer Engineering.</p>


<p>Moreover, apart from academics, my contribution was immense in extra-curricular activities mainly seminars. One box of thought arose in my mind which pushed me to face challenges in a plethora of technical and non-technical events. I served as a designing candidate in IEEE and organized several events for the same. I always loved being a part of numerous competitions that was held in my school and college. Not only this I also took a six-month course at an institute called Frameboxx in Graphic Design where I learned different software of Adobe.In my last year, I worked on a project name “College Canteen Food Ordering” which generally deals with one of the most common problems of getting your food in time during lunch breaks in colleges. It is a cross-platform application that allows users to operate from both androids as well a website.
  We decided to use flutter to make this application so anyone can use it on their mobile phone whether an android user or iPhone user which not only helped me with my project but I also gained knowledge about the framework, its use, and its advantage and its compatibility.</p>
